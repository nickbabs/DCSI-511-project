1. Project Background
There is a huge amount of data online, but the data that we need and how to acquire it can be very challenging. In this project, we use web scraping methods to retrieve and process data from Indeed and Craigslist. We chose Indeed because it is a very popular job searching platform with large amounts of data. Craigslist is another hub that contains a large amount of data that is closely related to our life and has many locations around the world.
2. We use python3, requests and the beautifulsoup function to do web scraping which creates our dataset. We then uploaded our dataset locally by using MySql 8.0, where it can also be downloaded from which we demonstrate in our code.
3. The biggest challenge for web scraping is becoming comfortable with the website's structure, especially when they intentionally design their pages to make web scraping more difficult. For example, Indeed changed its websiteâ€™s structure in October 2021 and built much more complicated website structures to limit web scraping. Another challenge is with the raw data that we are extracting not always being well structured and sometimes not even available. We need to process raw data and analyze it after we retrieve data from the internet to be sure our dataset is a complete and well structured set. Indeed and Craigslist always have the option of changing their website structure in the future to make web scraping more challenging, and if this happens, it could crash our code. Or they could prevent users from web scraping in general, similar to the way Glassdoor does.
4. For the distribution of our project, our dataset has been uploaded to MySql and our code has been uploaded to a GitHub repository and made available to the public. The following link will direct you to a GitHub repository that contains our code:  'https://github.com/nickbabs/DSCI-511-project'.
